Stratified Sampling – Population Mean Estimation

This repository provides an R-based implementation for estimating the population mean using stratified sampling techniques. The population is partitioned into homogeneous subgroups to improve estimation efficiency and precision.

The methodology focuses on sample size determination under an allowable sampling error and demonstrates proportional, Neyman, and optimised allocation strategies. The optimised design explicitly incorporates survey cost and time constraints, making the approach suitable for practical, real-world data collection scenarios.

The repository also includes graphical visualisation of the sampling design, illustrating population distribution and subgroup-wise sample allocation under different strategies.
